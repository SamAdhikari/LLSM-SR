R code for the paper #"Analysis of Longitudinal Advice-Seeking Networks Following Implementation of High Stakes Testing"#

We implement a Bayesian longitudinal latent space network model with covariates and random sender receiver effects, to study the advice-seeking network of teachers in schools within a school district and investigate
changes in advice-seeking behavior following the interventions.

See "Example.R" for an illustration on how to generate the networks and fit the model in the simulated dataset.
